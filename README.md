## About Me

Hey there! I’m a developer who spent years building, breaking, and rebooting products. My journey has taken me from hands-on coding to platform engineering, developer experience (DX), and open source advocacy. Along the way, I’ve helped startups survive (and sometimes thrive) by sharing both my hard-won lessons and technical know-how.

- 🏗️ **Platform Engineering & DX:** Building scalable, developer-friendly platforms is my jam.
- 💡 **OSS Advocate:** I love all things open source-contributions, community, and collaboration.
- 🧑‍🚀 **Startup Ally:** I advise and support early-stage teams as they navigate the chaos, celebrate the wins, and learn from the failures.
- 🏆 **Battle-Tested by Failure:** I wear my mistakes like badges of honor-they’re proof I’ve tried, failed, and come back stronger.

## What I’m Up To

- Helping startups architect their platforms and developer workflows
- Building and contributing to OSS projects
- Sharing ideas, code, and helping others
- Always learning, always iterating
