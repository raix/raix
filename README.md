## About Me

Hey there! I'm Morten - a developer, sidetracked founder, and “old rockstar” coder who's spent years building, breaking, and rebooting products. My journey has taken me from deep-in-the-trenches coding to platform engineering, developer experience (DX), and open source advocacy. Along the way, I've helped navigate chaos (and sometimes even thrive) by sharing hard-won lessons and technical know-how, with plenty of mistakes and laughs along the way.

- 🏗️ **Platform Engineering & DX:** Passionate about building scalable, developer-friendly platforms that empower teams to move fast and ship with confidence.
- 💡 **OSS Advocate:** I love all things open source - contributing, building community, and collaborating to create lasting impact.
- 🧑‍🚀 **Startup Ally:** I advise and support early-stage teams as they find their footing, celebrate the wins, and turn failures into fuel for growth.
- 🏆 **Battle-Tested by Failure:** I wear my mistakes like badges of honor - they're proof I've tried, failed, learned, and come back stronger (and with better stories).
